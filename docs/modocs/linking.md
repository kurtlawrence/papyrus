Linking an external crate and sharing data.

When running a REPL you might want to link an external crate.
The specific use case is a developer wants to link the crate they are working on
into the REPL for the user to be able to use.
A developer might also want to make data available to the REPL.
Papyrus has this functionality but makes some assumptions that the developer will
need to be aware of, detailed below.

## Worked Example

A REPL instance should always be created by invoking the macro `repl!()`.
In the examples below this will be elided for as the documentation won't compile with the macros.
The macro accepts a type ascription (such as `u32`, `String`, `MyStruct`, etc.) which defines the generic data constraint of the REPL.
When an evaluation call is made, a mutable reference of the same type will be required to be passed through.
Papyrus uses this data to pass it (across an FFI boundary) for the REPL to access.

To show the functionality of linking, let's work on a crate called `some-lib`.

### File Setup

***main.rs***:
```rust,no_run
#[macro_use]
extern crate papyrus;

use papyrus::prelude::*;

# #[cfg(not(feature = "runnable"))]
# fn main() {}

# #[cfg(feature = "runnable")]
fn main() {
  let mut repl = repl!();

  repl.run(&mut ());
}
```

***lib.rs***:
```rust
pub struct MyStruct {
  pub a: i32,
  pub b: i32,
}

impl MyStruct {
  pub fn new(a: i32, b: i32) -> Self {
    MyStruct { a, b }
  }

  pub fn add_contents(&self) -> i32 {
    self.a + self.b
  }
}
```

***Cargo.toml***:
```toml
[package]
name = "some-lib"

...

[lib]
name = "some_lib"
crate-type = ["rlib" ]
path = "src/lib.rs" # you may need path to the library

[dependencies]
papyrus = { version = "*", crate-type = [ "rlib" ] }
...
```

Notice that you will have to specify the _library_ with a certain `crate-type`.
Papyrus links using an `rlib` file, but it is shown that you can also build multiple library files.
If you build this project you should find a `libsome_lib.rlib` sitting in your build directory.
Papyrus uses this to link when compiling.
The `papyrus` dependency also requires a `crate-type` specification.
If not specified, references to `papyrus` in the _library_ will cause compilation errors when
running the REPL.

### REPL

Run this project (`cargo run`). It should spool up fine and prompt you with `papyrus=>`.
Now you can try to use the linked crate.

```sh
papyrus=> some_lib::MyStruct::new(20, 30).add_contents()
papyrus [out0]: 50
```

## Behind the scenes

- Papyrus takes the crate name you specify and will add this as `extern crate CRATE_NAME;` to the source file.
- When setting the external crate name, the `rlib` library is found and copied into the compilation directory.
  - Papyrus uses `std::env::current_exe()` to find the executing folder, and searches for the `rlib` file in that folder (`libCRATE_NAME.rlib`)
  - Specify the path to the `rlib` library if it is located in a different folder
- When compiling the REPL code, a rustc flag is set, linking the `rlib` such that `extern crate CRATE_NAME;` works.

## Passing `MyStruct` data through

Keep the example before, but alter the `main.rs` file.

***main.rs***:
```rust,ignore
#[macro_use]
extern crate papyrus;
extern crate some_lib;

use some_lib::MyStruct;

# #[cfg(not(feature = "runnable"))]
# fn main() {}

# #[cfg(feature = "runnable")]
fn main() {
  let mut app_data = MyStruct::new(20, 10);

  let mut repl = repl!(some_lib::MyStruct);

  repl.data = repl
    .data
    .with_extern_crate("some_lib", None)
    .expect("failed creating repl data");

  repl.run(&mut app_data);
}
```

Run this project (`cargo run`).
It should spool up fine and prompt you with `papyrus=>`.
Now you can try to use the linked data.
The linked data is in a variable `app_data`. It is borrowed or mutably borrowed depending on the
REPL state.

```sh
papyrus=> app_data.add_contents()
papyrus [out0]: 50
```

## Notes
### Panics

To avoid crashing the application on a panic, `catch_unwind` is employed.
This function requires data that crosses the boundary be `UnwindSafe`, making `&` and `&mut` not valid data types.
Papyrus uses `AssertUnwindSafe` wrappers to make this work, however it makes `app_data` vulnerable to breaking
invariant states if a panic is triggered.

The developer should keep this in mind when implementing a linked REPL. 
Some guidelines:

1. Keep the app_data that is being transfered simple.
2. Develop wrappers that only pass through a _clone_ of the data.

## Dependency Duplication
When linking an external library, the `deps` folder is linked to ensure that the dependencies that
the library is built with link properly. There are specific use cases where the rust compiler will
be unable to determine what dependencies to use. This happens when:
- The library has a dependency `depx`
- The REPL is asked to use a dependency `depx`
- The library and REPL both use the _exact same dependency structure_ for `depx`
  - This means that `depx` is the same version, and has the same feature set enabled
- The library and REPL both _use_ the dependency in code

As an example, the use of the `rand` crate might cause compilation issues to arise if the linked
external library also relies of `rand`. The exact cause is having both crates in the dependency
graph that rustc cannot discern between. The compilation error is however a good indication that
the external library needs to be supplying these transitive dependencies for the REPL's use, as the
REPL is really using the external library as a dependency (just in an indirect manner).
Usually an error message such as `error[E0523]: found two different crates with name `rand` that
are not distinguished by differing -C metadata. This will result in symbol conflicts between the
two.` would be encountered.

To solve this issue, any REPL dependency that could overlap with a library dependency be exposed by
the _library itself_. This can be done by using `pub use depx;` or `pub extern crate depx;` in the
root of the library source. Then, alter the `persistent_module_code` on the linking configuration
to include a statement such as `use external_lib::depx;` where the external lib is your library
name. If you library had the name `awesome` and you wanted to expose the `rand` crate you would add
`use awesome::rand;` to the `persistent_module_code` (make sure to test for whitespace and add if
necessary). There is access to the `persistent_module_code` through the
[`ReplData`](crate::repl::ReplData).

Adding this code effectively aliases the library dependency as if it was a root dependency of the
REPL. This trick is especially important if one is linking a library that makes use of the `kserd`
crate and has implemented `ToKserd` so data types can automatically be transferred across the REPL
boundary. The REPL needs to _not_ use the `kserd` dependency it is using and use the `kserd`
dependency from the external library. Using `use external_lib::kserd;` will manage this.

This is also important as then if the user of the REPL wants to implement `ToKserd` on REPL types,
it will still be using the consistent `kserd` dependency, although an astute user might try to
implement `::kserd::ToKserd` which would break! At least at this point it is easy to back out
changes in the temporary REPL session.
